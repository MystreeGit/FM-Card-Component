# Product Card Component
A challenge by Frontend Mentor

This was the first time in a couple months that I've worked on anything related to web development. I decided to start building up my skills once again starting with this challenge. I thought it would be a good idea to start off watching how someone tackled a problem like this and follow along. Now that I've finished this project (with the help of a tutorial of course), I plan on continueing to both participate and complete other challenges as well as copy pages from other sites to build up my skills. This time, of course, without a full video walkthrough.

While watching the video I saw different forms of abstraction, learned good practices, a real example of grid and flexbox being used, and various other small things which helped me further understand how simple things like this are created.
